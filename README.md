Genetic algorithm for Conway's Game of Life

This application tries to create an ideal setup for Conway's Game of Life that results in the most cells being alive at the end of the simulation. It will then output the score (amount of surviving cells at the final stage of the simulation) of the most successful setup produced by the evolutionary algorithm.
